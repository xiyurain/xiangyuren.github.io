I'm a first year Ph.D. student from [Institute for Computer System Architecture](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) of [School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research interest includes quantum computing architecture, quantum EDA and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Antonio Barbalace](https://www.barbalace.it/antonio/) and Raul.
