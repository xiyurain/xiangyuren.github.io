I'm a first year Ph.D. student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Antonio Barbalace](https://www.barbalace.it/antonio/) of [Institute for Computer System Architecture](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) from [School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/), Edinburgh University in United Kingdom.
